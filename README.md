## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation instructions

1. Clone the repository

`$ git clone https://github.com/ajmhyd/Bookshelf.git`


2. Move into the cloned directory

`$ cd Bookshelf`

3. Install dependencies

`$ npm install`

4. Start the app

`$ npm start`

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
